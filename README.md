# Random Walk Strategies

Welcome to **Random Walk Strategies** â€“ a project dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of randomness and its application to financial markets. This repository will dive deep into creating synthetic stock price datasets and experimenting with various trading strategies to navigate these unpredictable trends.

## Project Goals
The primary objective is to model and analyze stock price patterns using stochastic simulations, creating a sandbox environment to test the potential of different strategies. Through these simulations, we aim to gain insights into market movements and evaluate the effectiveness of various trading approaches.

## Strategies Explored So Far
- **Grid Strategy** (in progress)

Stay tuned as more strategies and results are added, showcasing the interplay of randomness and calculated decision-making in financial modeling!
